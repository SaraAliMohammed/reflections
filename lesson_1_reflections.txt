How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It help me to see the changes that i made and it's origin ,i can discover the difference by comparing fast.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    I can fast see every change i made and restore any version and anyone work with me can easily understand my changes.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    pros:
    	I can choose when to make a commit and what is the message .
    cons:
    	I may not remember to make a commit and then it will be hard to remember the changes i made.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git deals with any docs and when dealing with e.g. HTML,CSS,JS these docs may depends on eachother so i may made change at many doc. .
    Others don't have related docs .every doc is separate from others so any change in fie not affect others.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log : Show history and all commits.
    git diff: It show differences between changes i made in working directory and that in staging directory .
    			It can also take two arguments that represent two Commits'IDs and compare between them.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I can fast know the change which cause breaking and undo it.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I'll try to make repository and some commits.
